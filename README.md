# Sales Forecasting

## Business Problem

Accurately forecasting sales is one of the most difficult challenges faced by retailers worldwide, as sales can be influenced by many factors, such as promotions, competition, holidays, seasonality and locality. The project requires predicting 6 weeks of daily sales for 1,115 drug stores located across Germany. Reliable sales forecasts enable store managers to increase the overall productivity and profitability of the retail business, improve their customer satisfaction, and so on.

The challenges in this sales forecasting problem are to take into account various types of factors and to deal with missing data from historical records. Thus, you are commissioned to get the historical dataset fully prepared or pre-processed for further reliable and accurate forecasting. The major data preparation tasks, like integration, visualisation, cleaning, reduction and transformation, should be considered as appropriate, and a range of predictive modelling techniques can be explored.
